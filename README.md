# EduCoin

## Inspiration
Staying focused and being productive has become a more and more difficult task for students today. As a student myself, I wanted to find a solution to help me stay focused and worked much more effectively than productivity timers (Pomodoro timers), distraction blockers, or apps for focusing.

## What It Does
EduCoin is a productivity app that allows students to create an account and start earning "Educoins" for being productive. Students can choose from three student-oriented timers, including Quick Task, Long Assignment, or Study, and be distraction free during that duration of time. After collecting enough "Educoins," students can trade in their "Educoins" for school supplies, tutoring, exam prep, or scholarships in the student store, thus incentivizing them to keep working and collecting "Educoins."

## How I Built It
EduCoin was built with Swift and Firebase for backend work, like user authentication. 

## What's Next for EduCoin
I hope to add additional features like goal setting or friendly competitions between students to further incentivize productivity.
